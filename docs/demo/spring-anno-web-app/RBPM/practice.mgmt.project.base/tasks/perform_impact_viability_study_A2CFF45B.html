    Background
</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
    Impact Analysis is carried out by the Project Manager after the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../core.default.work_products.base/workproducts/investment_summary_428AEE39.html" guid="_nhJm8M63EeOzr-lCgvly5g">Investment Summary</a> for the project have been defined. This activity builds and
    expands on the risk assessments already earlier in the project lifecycle, in order to determine the scope and level of
    detail required in a possible subsequent viability study document.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    Where low levels of risk are identified in certain areas, then the need to carry out the full Viability Study is
    reduced, and effort is therefore likely to be reduced in subsequent activities. In some cases, the recommendation may
    be that no Viability Study is performed, and instead the project moves directly to the Requirements Gathering process.
</p></div>
<div class="stepHeading">Perform Viability Study</div>
<div class="stepContent"><p class="bodytext">
    The Viability Study activity is performed in order to establish the business, technical viability, and/or the
    architectural compliance of the solution selected the Prioritisation process. The study is carried out according to the
    scope recommended in the Impact Analysis Report.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    The Viability Study Report recommends whether the organisation should proceed with the project or, if necessary, to
    revisit the Clear Choice document or the clear choice selection in Prioritisation.

<h3 class="heading3">
    Background
</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
    A Viability Study is carried out by the Project Manager, based on the findings of the Impact Analysis Report. This
    process determines the practicality (that is, viability) of the project in different areas including business,
    technical, and architectural compliance viability.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    The aim of Viability is to investigate areas of uncertainty, identified in Impact Analysis, until they are no longer
    uncertain and their impact is understood.
