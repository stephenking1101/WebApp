<h2 class="pageTitle">Task: Build Project Deliverables</h2>
</div>
<h3 class="sectionHeading">Purpose</h3>
<div class="sectionContent sectionCell"><p class="bodytext">
    The Build process is performed in order to create the deliverables needed to fulfil the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../core.default.work_products.base/workproducts/business_requirements_58B9BECB.html" guid="_-9hcVpP3Ed-BHuyCwQrnpw">Business Requirements</a> and verify that they are ready for use within the following
    project activity. The following activity may vary by project technical domain (e.g., Testing for Software Engineering
    projects, Occupation for Building Construction projects, etc.).
</p></div>
<div class="sectionContent sectionCell"><h3 class="heading3">
    Background
</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
    Build is the construction activity that transforms the Design deliverables into the final project deliverables that
    provide the functionality requested by the Project Sponsor/Budget Owner. The Build deliverables are tightly coupled
    with the project technical domain and may include new business process, software modules, a new physical site, training
    coursework, marketing campaign, operational procedures, etc
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    The Build activity is initiated following the certification of the Build readiness of the Design deliverables. It may
    be revisited following the detection of a defect resulting from flawed Build tasks, design flaws, changes in the design
    deliverables, or approved changes in requirements.
</p>
<h3 class="heading3">
    Scope
</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
    Build has to do with the construction and quality control of the deliverables that provide the required functions to
    the customer. The construction techniques for Build deliverables vary greatly and are tightly coupled to the project
    technical domain.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    The deliverables that will be implemented/installed for the customer's use are created, reviewed, and certified as
    meeting the customer requirements in this activity.
</p></div>
<h3 class="sectionHeading">Steps</h3>
<div class="sectionContent sectionCell">
<div class="stepHeading">Plan and manage build activity</div>
<div class="stepContent"><p>
    Management of the Build activity is performed to ensure that all project deliverables are delivered within the triple
    constraints of time, cost and quality and provide the functionality as defined in the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../core.default.work_products.base/workproducts/business_requirements_58B9BECB.html" guid="_-9hcVpP3Ed-BHuyCwQrnpw">Business Requirements</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Plan
</h4>
<p class="bodytext">
    The Project Manager works with the Build team(s) to identify all discrete deliverables to be constructed and agrees to
    frequency of status updates by the team(s). The Project Manager loads their details into the Project Deliverables Log
    that was created in the Design activity. To ensure traceability of requirements, the Build Deliverables should be
    related to one or more Design Deliverables. Likewise a single Design Deliverable may relate to more than one Build
    Deliverable. In other words, there is a many to many relationship between Design and Build deliverables.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    The Project Manager updates the project work plan with new detail that arises from these regular Build team status
    updates.
</p>
<h4>
    Manage
</h4>
<p class="bodytext">
    Throughout the Build activity, the Project Manager receives regular progress status from the Build team(s). The status
    is used to update the Project Deliverables Log and for regular progress reporting.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    The Project Manager is expected to apply the standard Project Management best practices of managing risk, providing
    regular status to key stakeholders and manage the project scope, schedule, cost and quality throughout the Build
    activity.
</p></div>
<div class="stepHeading">Review and approve build deliverables</div>
<div class="stepContent"><p class="bodytext">
    The final core process of the Build activity ensures that all deliverables, appropriate to the project technical
    domain, deliver all the functionality defined in the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../core.default.work_products.base/workproducts/business_requirements_58B9BECB.html" guid="_-9hcVpP3Ed-BHuyCwQrnpw">Business Requirements</a> and achieve the level of quality defined in the project
    Quality plan.
</p>
<h4>
    Approach
</h4>
<p class="bodytext">
    Review and Approve Build Deliverables consists of two stages, Build Deliverables Review and Build Deliverables
    Certification. The Build Deliverable Review is conducted by a team of project stakeholders with the requisite technical
    skills in the technical domain to validate that the deliverables are of sufficient quality and that they deliver the
    functionality to the customer as defined in the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../core.default.work_products.base/workproducts/business_requirements_58B9BECB.html" guid="_-9hcVpP3Ed-BHuyCwQrnpw">Business Requirements</a>. It may be accomplished on all deliverables at once, on
    individual deliverables as they are completed or in phases or groups of deliverables as appropriate to the project
    plan.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    Build Deliverables Certification is a final review of all approved Build Deliverables that are to be implemented in the
    current project phase. It is accomplished in a meeting chaired by the Project Manager and attended by key stakeholders
    representing customers, design team(s), build team(s) and implementation/installation team(s). Other stakeholder groups
    (e.g., HOST Security, Compliance, Legal, Regulatory agencies, etc.) may participate based on their understanding of the
    project deliverables and how they are to be used within the customer organization or by customers individually.
</p>
<h4>
    Review
</h4>
<p class="bodytext">
    The deliverables are reviewed and approved in meetings with the Build team(s) and other key stakeholder representatives
    as deemed appropriate by the Project Manager. The review process may be iterative with feedback from the reviewers
    compiled by the Build team and incorporated into the deliverables prior to the next review. Once the reviewers are
    satisfied with the deliverables, they approve them as ready for Build certification.
</p>
<h4>
    Review Guidelines
</h4>
<p class="bodytext">
    Deliverables may be reviewed and approved individually as they are completed. They may be reviewed in groups as
    appropriate to the project methodology or implementation plan such as reviewing all phase 1 deliverables as a group.
</p>
<h4>
    Certify build deliverables
</h4>
<p class="bodytext">
    The project manager holds a final build certification workshop with key stakeholders from the build team(s), design
    team(s), user representatives, implementation/installation team(s) and any representatives of any other organisation
    that may have an interest in the successful completion of the project. The goal of the workshop is to validate the
    readiness of all design deliverables as of sufficient quality and functionality as defined in earlier activities and
    that they are ready for the next project activity.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    Any deliverable flaws or exceptions to defined quality and functionality specifications that are discovered must be
    fully documented with mitigation/remediation plans or designated exceptions and approved by the participants as
    acceptable for proceeding to the next activity. Failure to get such approval will require the build team(s) to correct
    the deficiencies that must be validated in a follow on build certification workshop.
</p>
<h4>
    Certify Guidelines
</h4>
<p class="bodytext">
    The workshop produces final Build Readiness certification documentation on which all appropriate Stakeholders sign-off.
    This documentation certifies that the Build deliverables are of sufficient quality and scope to start the next project
    activity. The exact form and structure of the documentation may vary according to the project technical domain. It may
    even take the form of an e-mail summary of the Build Certification workshop recommendations that is circulated to key
    Stakeholders for approval. All Build Certification documentation must be kept in the project documentation repository
    for the length of time depending on the legal and compliance dictates of the project environment. For projects with a
    Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) impact, the retention period for project documentation is seven (7) years.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    The next project activity may vary depending on the project technical domain. For example, IT projects will proceed to
    System or System Integration Test. Construction projects may proceed to building turnover and Business Process
    Re-engineering projects may proceed to User Training.&nbsp;
