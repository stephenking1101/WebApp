<h2 class="pageTitle">Task: Design Project Deliverables</h2>
</div>
<h3 class="sectionHeading">Purpose</h3>
<div class="sectionContent sectionCell"><p>
    The Design process is performed in order to define how the project deliverables will be constructed during
    the&nbsp;Build activity and delivered to the customer during Implementation. Because the actual Design process is so
    closely coupled to the technical domain the actual work of design may be governed by methodologies external to RBPM.
    The core processes listed here are generic by nature and the technical team charged with completing the design should
    follow the methodology specific to the project's technical domain. The primary RBPM processes in this activity are
    limited to project management activities of monitoring and reporting progress of the technical teams.
</p></div>
<div class="sectionContent sectionCell"><h3>
    Background
</h3>
<p>
    Design is the technical activity that transforms the business requirements into a definition of what will be
    implemented and how it will be constructed.
</p>
<p>
    The Design activity is initiated once the business requirements are approved by the Project Sponsor/Budget Owner, but
    is revisited following the detection of a defect resulting from flawed design or a change in the requirements or build
    specifications.
</p></div>
<h3 class="sectionHeading">Steps</h3>
<div class="sectionContent sectionCell">
<div class="stepHeading">Manage Design</div>
<div class="stepContent"><p class="bodytext">
    Management of the processes that comprise the Design activity is essential to ensure that all design deliverables,
    appropriate to the project technical domain, are sufficiently detail to facilitate succeeding processes and are
    delivered within the constraints of time, cost and quality. This is an ongoing process that continues throughout the
    entire design activity.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    At the start of Design, the project manager should establish a log of artefacts to be delivered by the technical
    team(s). The log should include the following:
</p>
<ul class="listbullet">
    <li class="listbullet">
        Artefact name
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        Technical team responsible for it
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        Team lead with contact information
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        Expected delivery date
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        Current status and status date
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        Comments on delivery of the artefact
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="bodytext">
    The project manager should regularly update the log via scheduled artefact status from the technical team lead(s) for
    reporting purposes. The frequency and format of the status gathering may be documented in the overall project
    communication plan.
</p>
<h3 class="heading3">
    Deliverables
</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
    A complete set of design deliverables is reviewed and approved according to the dictates of the technical domain
    methodology.
</p></div>
<div class="stepHeading">Review Design</div>
<div class="stepContent"><p class="bodytext">
    The deliverables are reviewed and approved in meetings between the design team(s) and build team(s). Other key
    stakeholder representatives are included as is deemed appropriate by the project manager.
</p>
<h3 class="heading3">
    Guidance
</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
    Deliverables may be reviewed and approved individually as they are completed. They may be reviewed in groups as
    appropriate to the project methodology or development structure (for example, all functional design deliverables may be
    reviewed as a group).
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    Review and approval of the design deliverables is generally an iterative process with the technical teams receiving
    feedback, incorporating it into the deliverables and re-submitting them for review and approval until a consensus on
    approval is reached.
</p></div>
<div class="stepHeading">Certfiy Build Readiness</div>
<div class="stepContent"><p class="bodytext">
    The project manager holds a final build readiness workshop with key stakeholders from the design technical teams, user
    representatives and build teams to validate the readiness of all design deliverables to instruct the Build team in how
    to successfully construct the project product/system/service.
</p>
<h3 class="heading3">
    Guidance
</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
    The workshop produces a build readiness certificate that all appropriate stakeholders sign-off. This document is
    typically determined by the project technical domain and it certifies that the project is ready to start the build
    activity. The project manager may use an e-mail requesting approval by all key design stakeholders as the certificate.
    The approved document should be filed in the project document repository.
