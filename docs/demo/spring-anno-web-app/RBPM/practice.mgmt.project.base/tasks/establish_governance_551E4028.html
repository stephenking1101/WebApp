    </li>
    <li>
        Identify planned meetings or other forums that the project team has determined will be necessary to properly
        monitor, control, and/or govern the project. Provide details as known to include participants (named or role),
        schedule, and purpose.

<h3>
    Responsibility matrix guidelines
</h3>
<p>
    The responsibility matrix details the relationships between roles and deliverables. The rows on the matrix show the
    standard list of deliverables from each of the various project stages. The column titles show the various roles
    involved in the different aspects of the project.
</p>
<p>
    The action to be performed against the deliverable by the role is shown at the intersections between the two. There are
    four options for this:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Responsible (R) - This shows that the individual detailed by role produces, or is responsible for producing, the
        deliverable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Approves / Signs Off (A) - This shows that the individual detailed by role is responsible for approving / signing
        off the deliverable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Contributes (C) - This shows that role provides input to the deliverable.
    </li>
    <li>
        Informed (I) - This shows that the individual detailed by role is a reviewer of the deliverable.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Only roles defined in the role overviews should be used. Responsibility Matrix or RACI Template can be accessed <a href="http://teams.global.exampleCom/hts/methodology/project/Templates/RACI_Template.xlsx" target="_blank">here</a>.

    The Change Control process ensures that due consideration is given to the impact of requirement change (business or

<h3>
    Procedure
</h3>
<ol>
    <li>
        Identify the driving project constraint. For&nbsp;example, scope, budget, schedule or quality).&nbsp;While managing
        the changes, the driving constraint&nbsp;will have overriding consideration
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine the roles and responsibilities for managing the changes. Typical roles include - Change Control Board,
        Change Evaluator etc.
    </li>
    <li>
        Establish the evaluation process. See&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../discipline.change_control.base/guidances/practices/change_control_681657EB.html" guid="_xMVMUGlUEeKBe7PD2O-dCw">Change Control</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Establish guidelines for communicating changes to the project team
    </li>
</ol></div>
<div class="stepHeading">Define Risk Management Plan</div>
<div class="stepContent"><p>
    Risk Management Planning is conducted to define the process of how to engage and oversee risk management activities for
    a project. Risk Management planning is an important part of project management. Having a plan on how to manage risk
    allows project teams to proactively prepare and plan for risks rather than being in a reactive mode should a risk
    materialise to an issue. Early engagement of Risk Management planning increases the possibility of success of all risk
    management activities and processes especially if the process definition was created with input and buy-in from the
    project manager and key project stakeholders.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
    Based on the discussion with Project Steering Committee and key stakeholders,&nbsp;document the&nbsp;following:
</p>
<ul class="listbullet">
    <li class="listbullet">
        <strong>Methodology</strong>: Methodology describes how the Risk Management processes will be performed, the tools
        which will be utilised, and the data source for handling risk.
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        <strong>Roles and responsibilities</strong>: Roles and responsibilities matrix identifies the lead, support, and
        assigns people to the roles clarifying their responsibility and accountability.
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        <strong>Timing</strong>: Timing clarifies the frequency of the risk management process and schedules some risk
        management activities in the project schedule. Without timely monitoring and response, risks can easily escalate
        into negative events or become missed opportunities because you failed to exploit them.
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        <strong>Risk categories</strong>: Risk categories are potential causes of risk included in the Risk Management Plan
        for use during the Risk Identification and Risk Analysis processes..
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        <strong>Definitions of risk probability and impact</strong>: Agreeing on standard definitions (for probability:
        rare, unlikely, often, likely, or expected; for impact: insignificant, minor, moderate, major, or massive) helps to
        ensure that everyone is communicating on the same wavelength. Definitions are included in the Risk Management Plan
        for later use during Risk Analysis.
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        <strong>Probability and impact matrix</strong>: The probability and impact matrix assists in determining the
        absolute risk score by combining the two dimensions of a risk: its probability of occurrence, and its impact on
        objectives.
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        <strong>Revised stakeholder tolerances</strong>: As discussions become more specific during planning meetings about
        actual risks and actual costs, schedules, scope, objectives, and quality criteria, you get a better idea of your
        stakeholders' tolerance for risk than you had at the start of the process.
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        <strong>Reporting formats</strong>: Reporting formats depict the content and format of the risk register. The Risk
        Register is a document on which you record identified risks and their characteristics (this information should be
        documented in the corporate Project Management Tool, if available).
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        <strong>Tracking</strong>: Tracking describes how and when risk information will be documented and reviewed for the
        benefit of current project, future needs, and lessons learned. Tracking also specifies whether risk management
        processes will be audited.
    </li>
</ul></div>
<div class="stepHeading">Define Artifact (Configuration) Management Plan</div>
<div class="stepContent"><p class="bodytext">
    The Configuration Management process involves controlling the numerous artefacts produced by the many people working on
    a project. The purpose is to avoid costly confusion and ensure that resultant artefacts are not in conflict due to the
    following problems:
</p>
<ul class="listbullet">
    <li class="listbullet">
        Simultaneous update to the same artefact by more than one team member.
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        Limited notification – when a problem is fixed in artefacts shared by several team members, and some of them are
        not notified of the change.
    </li>
    <li class="listbullet">
        Multiple versions – one may be in production while another is in development. Fixes to one version need to be
        propagated to the others as appropriate in a controlled way, otherwise, confusion can arise leading to costly fixes
        and re-work.
    </li>
</ul>
