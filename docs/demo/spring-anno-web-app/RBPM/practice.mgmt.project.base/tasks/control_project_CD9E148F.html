<div class="stepHeading">Control Quality</div>
<div class="stepContent"><p class="bodytext">
    Quality Control consists of the execution of project tasks according to the pre-agreed standards. This includes both
    the generic Group standards, and any project specific controls which may have been developed to meet a specific quality
    need for the project. The purpose of Quality Control is to identify non conformances and defects and ensure they are
    corrected so that defect-free work-products or deliverables will be produced.
</p>
<h3 class="heading3">
    Procedure
</h3>
<p class="bodytext">
    There is no routine procedure for quality control. It involves monitoring specific project results to determine if they
    comply with relevant quality standards and identifying ways to eliminate causes of unsatisfactory performance. It is
    applicable throughout the project. Information about both planned and expected results from the project plan should be
    available with the information about the actual results. Quality tools and techniques are used to assist in performing
    these activities (see Tools and techniques Guidelines below).&nbsp;
