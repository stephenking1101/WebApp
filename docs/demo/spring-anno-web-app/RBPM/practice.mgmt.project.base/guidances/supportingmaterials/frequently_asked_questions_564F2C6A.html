    <strong>I am a project manger within SWD, what do I use?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You follow <a href="/swd_sdlc/" target="_blank">SDLC</a>. We have worked
    with SWD team to ensure the SDLC fully aligns to and is compliant with RBPM.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How does the Change Project Lifecycle align with the Programme Management Framework?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Change Project Lifecycle leverages and aligns to the content within the Programme Management Framework (for
    example, the stages – Definition, Execution and Closure are the same, as are the tollgates).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How many other lifecycles are there?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    At present, there is one other lifecycle which is compliant to RBPM. This is the System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
    and is to be used by Software Delivery (SWD) Project Managers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Is the use of the Change Project Lifecycle mandatory?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    No – it is not mandatory for you to use the Project Lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Am I compliant with RBPM standards and controls if I use the Project Lifecycle to help plan and manage my
    projects?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Yes. The Change Project Lifecycle does not change of any the RBPM standards and controls it simply has ordered the
    activities and tasks in a sequential and logical way.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What is a tollgate and is the use of this mandatory?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A tollgate occurs at the end of and before the start of the next stage. It is a checkpoint to see whether your project
    is on the right track to deliver the agreed business outcomes and benefits, and allows you to make a decision on
    whether to stop, start or review elements of the project before proceeding to the next state.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How does the Change Project Lifecycle relate to Process Groups?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Change Project Lifecycle uses Stages to provide a sequential order to the Process Groups. Process Groups span
    throughout the project lifecycle. See <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../practice.mgmt.project.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/process_groups_vs_lifecycle_7044CF6F.html" guid="_Kx8fUB3MEeK4uI-M5YgVIg">Process Groups vs Lifecycle</a>&nbsp;for further information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Will there be any other future changes?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We are continuously working to improve RBPM and align it to industry standards and exampleCom best practice. We achieve this
    by leveraging your feedback and working with your local representative to help enhance, simplify and refresh RBPM
    content.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Why is Initiation not covered in the Change Project Lifecycle?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Please continue to use existing RBPM content on how to initiate projects.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Are they are changes to the mandatory documents or any others that I need to complete?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    No.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I have an improvement suggestion – how can I provide my feedback?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We welcome your feedback – please&nbsp;click on Feedback button&nbsp;in the top right hand corner&nbsp;for further
    guidance.<br />
